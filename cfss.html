                     Using IoT, Internet of Thing, technologies makes intelligent of objects 
                     which through various micro-sensors implanted in the wafer then with a wireless network
                     connecting the Internet. To realize people and objects dialogue, 
                     exchange of dialogue between people and objects, and among objects and objects are dependent 
                     on data exchanges which are very important for current research trends in artificial intelligent sciences. 
                     So that the object in contact with people's lives can become wiser awareness. 
                     With the continuous deployment of data analysis applications and technologies, 
                     many important awareness services will be proposed. 
                     Those data can be analyzed to reveal interesting relationships, detect events 
                     and find unforeseen and unknown patterns for context awareness. 
                     The goal of this special issue is to provide an opportunity for researchers, 
                     engineers and scientists to publish their research results related 
                     to the innovative applications of intelligent data collection and analysis for context awareness.

                     Awareness Computing is the ability of a system or system component to gather information about its environment at any given time and adapt behaviors accordingly.  Awareness computing uses software and hardware to collect and analyze data to guide responses automatically. Awareness computing is a state for a subject to perceive the moment when relevant information arrives. It is not only essential for the survival of any living species but also a fundamental ability leading to higher-level intelligence. The objective of awareness computing, therefore, is to utilize computing technologies to build a system that is aware. More specifically, the goal of awareness computing is to incorporate the latest sensing capabilities of diverse signals with smart computing systems to stay in constant observing and awareness states, such as power-aware, location-aware, and context-aware, under a unified computational framework. Image understanding algorithms often enhance system awareness. Many deep learning algorithms are applied to image objects recognition. If we can integrate image recognition and awareness computing, many innovation applications will be fulfilling.

                     The combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoTs), called AIoT has become the current and future trend. Today, IoT devices are ubiquitous. People are increasingly accustomed to the convenience and personalized services provided by IoT devices. Data are accumulated continuously, and a large amount of data promote AI feasible for reliable analysis. More and more industries began to introduce AI technologies. Discussing and developing the technologies and applications of AIoT will help promote the industry’s future progress. This special session aims to discuss any IoTs and AI-related knowledge and innovative applications of AIoT. Prospective authors are invited to submit original papers to the Special Session.
